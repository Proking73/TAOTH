## About Us
**The Art of the Heart** is an organization dedicated to uplifting and supporting all forms of artistic expression — **Visual Arts, Performing Arts, and Literature**.  
Our mission centers on helping students and emerging artists discover and nurture a genuine love for the arts.

We believe the arts are more than a career path or labor; they are a profound part of the human heart. Passion drives creativity, and creativity enriches lives.  
Our goal is to foster a culture where art is pursued for its meaning, fulfillment, and personal growth.

## Our Mission
- Promote the arts as a personal pursuit, not just a profession  
- Support students learning to embrace creativity and artistic expression  
- Increase access to artistic opportunities for underserved communities  
- Provide resources that encourage passion-driven exploration of the arts  

---

## Why We Exist
Many aspiring artists step away from their craft due to:
- Lack of funding  
- Limited opportunities  
- Insufficient support or encouragement  

To combat these challenges, **100% of the funds generated by our organization are donated** to partner organizations that invest directly in artistic development, education, and accessibility.

By supporting us, you help fuel creativity where it’s needed most.
